; Default upload via ST-Link (most common). If you have an ST-Link dongle,
; this will use it. To use OpenOCD, see commented example below.
upload_protocol = stlink

; Serial monitor speed (adjust if needed)
monitor_speed = 115200

; Optional: set verbosity / keep build output consistent
; build_unflags = -Werror   ; example: remove if you want to allow warnings

; Example: build/upload with:
;   pio run -e bluepill_f103c8
;   pio run -e bluepill_f103c8 -t upload
;   pio device monitor -e bluepill_f103c7

; If you prefer OpenOCD with a specific board config, you can change to:
; upload_protocol = openocd
; upload_flags = -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f1x.cfg
; (Uncomment and adjust paths to cfg files on your system)
